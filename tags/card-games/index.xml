      <description>Prologue Card game war is very popular because of it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity. Game seems totally random but I thought that there must be better or worse way of playing, so I ran quite a few simulations to find it out.
Possible strategies Only thing that we control during the game is the way how to collect won cards. I found out only 3 diffrent ways of collecting cards:
 Starting from player A&amp;rsquo;s pile Starting from player B&amp;rsquo;s pile Starting from player&amp;rsquo;s that won pile  Cards are always collected interchangeably from 2 piles so only difference is from wich to start from.</description>
